# GRC Engineering Python Fundamentals

Python fundamentals learned through GRC Engineering problems. Every exercise uses compliance data — controls, findings, evidence records, and framework mappings — instead of generic examples.

## What This Is

A complete set of Python exercises paralleling [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition) by Eric Matthes, recontextualized for GRC Engineering. The concepts are identical (variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, classes, files, testing). The data is NIST 800-53, FedRAMP High, and CJIS v6.0.

Chapters 1–11 cover fundamentals. Chapters 12–20 replace the book's projects (Alien Invasion, data visualization, Django web app) with three GRC-relevant builds:

- **Project 1:** GRC Audit CLI Tool (Chapters 12–14)
- **Project 2:** Compliance Data Analysis (Chapters 15–17)
- **Project 3:** Compliance API with Flask (Chapters 18–20)

## Frameworks Referenced

- **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** — control IDs, families, and baselines used throughout all exercises
- **FedRAMP High** — baseline selection, evidence collection, and continuous monitoring exercises
- **CJIS v6.0** — MFA validation, FIPS 140-3 encryption checks, and CJI access controls

## How I'm Learning

Exercises are worked through manually with no AI-generated solutions. The [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) file configures Claude Code as a tutor that reviews my work, runs my code, and gives hints — but never writes solutions. The full exercise set is in [`grc_python_crash_course.md`](grc_python_crash_course.md).
